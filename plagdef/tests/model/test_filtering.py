# The notion of an overlap:
# While Sanchez-Perez et al. define two clusters as overlapping when they share at least one sentence in the
# suspicious document, PlagDef follows a different approach.
# This is because PlagDef takes a set of documents without knowing which are sources and which are plagiarism cases.
# Therefore it can very well be the case that doc1 used a fragment of doc2 multiple times but also vice versa:
# 1) doc1 copied from doc2:
#   A fragment from doc2 is matched multiple times to different fragments in doc1 and therefore belongs to different
#   clusters/cases.
#   But NEVER vice versa for the same fragment.
# 2) doc2 copied from doc1:
#   A fragment from doc1 is matched multiple times to different fragments in doc2 and therefore belongs to different
#   clusters/cases.
#   But NEVER vice versa for the same fragment.
# => So if there is a fragment in doc2 which is part of more than one cluster/case ("doc1 copied from doc2") and these
#   particular clusters simultaneously share a fragment in doc1 ("doc2 copied from doc1"), they are considered
#   overlapping.
# In short PlagDef defines two clusters as overlapping if they share a sentence in doc1's and also in doc2's fragment.
# It then considers both variants 1 and 2 and picks the one of higher quality for each of the overlapping clusters.
# Finally all clusters but the in this sense best cluster are discarded.
